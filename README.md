This project is the implementation of the sketch design in the repo. The sketch design did not implement using flexbox or grid and had only one view: on screen widths of 1440px.

I implemented the design on the given view-width, made some low-level interactivity and animations, and made the design responsive based on what I thought would be a decent responsive design.
